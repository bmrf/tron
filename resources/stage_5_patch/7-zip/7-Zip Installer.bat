:: Author:        reddit.com/user/vocatus ( vocatus.gate@gmail.com ) // PGP key: 0x07d1490f82a211a2
:: History:       1.2.2-TRON * Make architecture-agnostic, now will detect correct system architecture and install relevant package
::                           * Replace all hard-coded system file paths with relevant variable for better portability
::                1.2.1-TRON - Remove logging of ftype and assoc output since it's not of any consequence
::                1.2.0-TRON - Remove logging functions since Tron handles logging
::                1.0.0      + Initial write

:: Usage:         Run the script and pass one of the following arguments to it:
::                  associate_common  Associate 7-Zip with the common file compression formats 
::                                     (7z,bz2,bzip2,gz,gzip,lzh,lzma,rar,tar,tgz,zip)
::                  associate_all     Associate 7-zip with ALL the file compression formats it supports
::
::                e.g. 7-Zip v9.20.bat associate_all  
::
::                Default is "associate_common" unless told otherwise
