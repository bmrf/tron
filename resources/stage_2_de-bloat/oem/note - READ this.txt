There are two files in this directory that determine what Tron targets for bloatware removal:

1. programs_to_target_by_name.txt
2. programs_to_target_by_GUID.bat

Insert program names, one per line, into the text file 'programs_to_target_by_name.txt'
Tron will TRY to uninstall any program whose name matches one of the names in this file.
Don't put any special characters around the name (quotes, commas, etc). Spaces are fine.
Tron uses WMI queries inside a batch file, so the wildcard character is double-percent (%%).

Example:

    Cyberlink%%
    Dell Getting Started Guide%%
    Dell Video%%
    %%Toolbar%%

The scanner will iterate through the list of programs, one by one, and try to uninstall any program matching that entry. 

In this example:
	
	Dell%%

...would catch and attempt to remove both "Dell Getting Started Guide" AND "Dell Video."

Secondly, you can list specific GUIDs to target in "programs_to_target_by_GUID.bat." This file is a batch file (not flat text) and gets called by Tron. The reason I made it a batch instead of plain text was so you can put comments over each GUID describing what it is.


 !! NOTE !!

Many programs do not register with WMI and so can't be targeted with this method. For those programs, you'll have to manually remove them. This stage is just a "best-effort" attempt to automate some of the tedium.

Godspeed
