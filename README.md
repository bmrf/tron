#Background

Tron is a script that "fights for the User"; basically automates a bunch of scanning/disinfection/cleanup tools on a Windows system. I got tired of running these utilities manually when doing cleanup jobs on individual client machines, and decided to just script the whole thing. I hope this helps other techs and admins.

#Stages of Tron:

Prep: rkill, WMI repair
Tempclean: CCLeaner, BleachBit
Disinfect: Emsisoft Commandline Scanner, Vipre Rescue Scanner, Sophos Virus Removal Tool, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, sfc /scannow
De-bloat: removes a variety of OEM bloatware; customizable list is in \resources\stage_3_de-bloat\programs_to_target.txt
Patch: Updates 7-Zip, Java, and Adobe Flash/Reader and disables nag/update screens (uses some of our PDQ packs); then installs all available Windows updates
Optimize: Defrag %SystemDrive% (usually C:); skipped if the drive is an SSD
Manual stuff: Contains some extra tools you can run manually if necessary (ComboFix, AdwCleaner, aswMBR, autoruns, etc.)

Saves a log to C:\Logs\tron.log.
