# DO NOT DOWNLOAD TRON FROM GITHUB, IT WILL NOT WORK!! YOU NEED THE ENTIRE PACKAGE FROM [/r/TronScript](https://www.reddit.com/r/TronScript) !!

I got tired of running these utilities manually and decided to just script everything, so Tron is essentially a glorified batch file that automates a variety of tasks to clean up/disinfect a Windows machine.

# USE

1. [Boot into Safe Mode with Network Support](#safe-mode). Safe Mode is not required but is strongly recommended.

2. Copy `tron.bat` and the `\resources` folder to the target machine and run `tron.bat` as an **ADMINISTRATOR** (Tron does not work if you don't it run as an Administrator)

3. Wait anywhere from **3-10 hours** (yes, it takes that long)

4. Reboot

By default the master log file is at `C:\Logs\tron\tron.log`. If you want to change this, read the section on changing defaults below.

Tron will briefly check for a newer version when it starts up and notify you if one is found.

Depending how badly the system is infected, it could take anywhere from 3 to 10 hours to run. I've personally observed times between 4-8 hours, and one user reported a run time of 30 hours. Basically set it and forget it.


# COMMAND-LINE USE

Command-line use is fully supported. All flags are optional and can be combined. *

    tron.bat [-a -c -d -dev -e -er -m -o -p -r -sa -sb -sd -se -sfr
              -sk -sm -sp -spr -srr -ss -str -sw -v -x] | [-h]

    -a   Automatic mode (no welcome screen or prompts; implies -e)

    -c   Config dump (display current config. Can be used with other
         flags to see what WOULD happen, but script will never execute
         if this flag is used)

    -d   Dry run (run through script without executing any jobs)
    
    -dev Override OS detection (allow running on unsupported Windows versions)

    -e   Accept EULA (suppress disclaimer warning screen)

    -er  Email a report when finished. Requires you to configure SwithMailSettings.xml

    -h   Display help text

    -m   Preserve default Metro apps (don't remove them)

    -o   Power off after running (overrides -r)

    -p   Preserve power settings (don't reset to Windows default)

    -r   Reboot automatically (auto-reboot 15 seconds after completion)

    -sa  Skip ALL anti-virus scans (KVRT, MBAM, SAV)

    -sb  Skip de-bloat (OEM bloatware removal; implies -m)

    -sd  Skip defrag (force Tron to ALWAYS skip Stage 5 defrag)

    -se  Skip Event Log clear (don't clear Windows Event Logs)

    -sfr Skip filesystem permissions reset (saves time if you're in a hurry)

    -sk  Skip Kaspersky Virus Rescue Tool (KVRT) scan

    -sm  Skip Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (MBAM) installation

    -sp  Skip patches (do not patch 7-Zip, Java Runtime, Adobe Flash or Reader)

    -spr Skip page file reset (don't set to "Let Windows manage the page file")

    -srr Skip registry permissions reset (saves time if you're in a hurry)

    -ss  Skip Sophos Anti-Virus (SAV) scan

    -str Skip Telemetry Removal (don't remove Windows user tracking, Win7 and up only)

    -sw  Skip Windows Updates (do not attempt to run Windows Update)

    -v   Verbose. Show as much output as possible. NOTE: Significantly slower!

    -x   Self-destruct. Tron deletes itself after running and leaves logs intact

\* There is no -UPM flag


# SCRIPT INTERRUPTION

If the script is interrupted e.g. from a crash or a forced reboot (often encountered during stage_2_de-bloat), it will attempt to resume from the last stage successfully started. Tron accomplishes this by creating a `RunOnce` registry key for the current user at the beginning of Stage 0 (e.g. when jobs start executing), and deleting it at the end of the script if everything finished without interruption.

More details about this function are in the list of all Tron actions at the bottom of this document.


# SAFE MODE

In versions of Windows prior to 8, you could [follow these instructions](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode); basically it involves pressing F8 after restarting your computer.

However from Windows 8 onwared the process is a bit different. Microsoft, in their long-standing tradition of breaking useful, heavily-used functionality for no reason, changed how you get into Safe Mode, disabling the traditional F8 method. Tron re-enables the F8 method as part of it's prep tasks (before actually running), but here's how to manually re-enable the old-style boot menu that supports the F8 key. From an admin command prompt, run this command:

    bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy

Reboot and you should now be able to use F8 to select Safe Mode. Note that this command is the same one Tron runs, so if you launch Tron to the menu and then exit, you'll accomplish the same thing.


# EMAIL REPORT
To have Tron send an email report at completion, edit this file:

    \tron\resources\stage_7_wrap-up\email_report\SwithMailSettings.xml

Specify your SMTP server, username, and password. After specifying your settings you can use the `-er` flag to have Tron send the email report. The summary logs (`tron_removed_files.txt` and `tron_removed_programs.txt`) will be attached as well.

Keep in mind the username and password for the email account will be stored in PLAIN TEXT so don't leave it lying around on a system you don't trust.


# CHANGE DEFAULTS (advanced)

If you don't want to use the command-line and don't like Tron's defaults, you can change the following default variables. Keep in mind command-line flags will always override their respective default option when used.

  ```
  set QUARANTINE_PATH=%LOGPATH%\quarantine
  ```

- To change the location of the backups Tron makes (Registry, Event Logs, power scheme, etc), edit this line:
  ```
  set BACKUPS=%LOGPATH%\backups
  ```

# INTEGRITY

In every release `checksums.txt`, which contains SHA-256 hashes of *every* file included in Tron, is signed with my PGP key (`0x07d1490f82a211a2`, included). You can use it to verify package integrity.


# LICENSE

Tron and any included subscripts and `.reg` files I've written are free to use/redistribute/whatever under the **MIT license**. It'd be nice if you sent an email and let me know if you do something cool with it, but it's not required. All 3rd-party tools Tron calls (MBAM, TDSSK, etc) are bound by their respective licenses. It is YOUR responsibility to determine if you can use them in your specific situation.


# OTHER

I try to keep everything updated. If you notice some of the packages are out of date, PM me on reddit or send me an email (listed above), I respond pretty quickly most days.

Hope this is helpful to other PC techs,

# FULL TRON DESCRIPTION
The best way to see what Tron does is simply to crack open `Tron.bat` with a text editor (preferably one with syntax highlighting) or [on GitHub and just read the code](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/tron.bat). Every section has comments explaining exactly what it does, and you don't need to be able to read code to understand it. However, barring that, here's a general description of every action Tron performs.

## tron.bat
Master script that launches all the other tools. It performs a lot of actions on its own, but for any task we can't perform directly, we call an external utility or script


## Tron-internal prep jobs
(These are all executed even if Tron is canceled before running)

1. **Detect Windows version**: Determines quite a few things in the script, such as which versions of various commands get executed

2. **Unsupported OS blocker**: Throws an alert message if running on an unsupported OS then exits. Use Tron's `-dev` flag to override this behavior and allow running on unsupported Windows versions.

3. **Detect SSD**: Detect solid state hard drives. If found, tron skips the **Stage 5 defrag**

4. **Detect free space**: Detect and save available hard drive space to compare against later. Simply used to show how much space was reclaimed; does not affect any script functions

5. **Detect resume**: Detect whether or not we're resuming after an interrupted run (e.g. from a reboot)

6. **Enable F8 Safe Mode selection**: Re-enable the ability to use the `F8` key on bootup (Windows 8/8.1 only; enabled by default on Server 2012/2012 R2)

7. **Check for update**: Use `wget` to pull down `sha256sums.txt` from the Tron mirror and see if we're on the current version. Tron will ask to automatically download the newest version. If you answer yes, it will download a copy to the desktop, verify the SHA256 hash, and then self-destruct the current copy

8. **Detect Administrator rights**: Detect whether or not we're running as Administrator and alert the user if we're not

9. **Detect Safe Mode**: Detect whether or not we're in Safe Mode and notify the user if we're not

10. **Make log directories**: Create the master log directory and sub-directories if they don't exist


## STAGE 0: Prep

1. **Create RunOnce entry**: Create the following registry key to support resuming if there is an interruption: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce /v "tron_resume" /t REG_SZ /d "%~dp0tron.bat %-resume"`

2. **SMART check**: Run a quick SMART disk health check and notify if any drives don't report "OK" for their status

3. **Create System Restore point**: Windows Vista and up only; client OS's only (not supported on Server OS's). Tron creates a system restore snapshot before beginning operations

4. **[Rkill](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/)**: Rkill is an anti-malware prep tool; it looks for and kills a number of known malware that interfere with removal tools. Rkill will exclude any process listed in `\resources\stage_0_prep\rkill\rkill_process_whitelist.txt` from being closed

5. **ProcessKiller**: Utility provided by /u/cuddlychops06 which kills various userland processes. We use this to further kill anything that might interfere with Tron. Specifically, it kills everything in userland with the exception of the following processes: `ClassicShellService.exe`, `explorer.exe`, `dwm.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `mbam.exe`, `teamviewer.exe`, `TeamViewer_Service.exe`, `Taskmgr.exe`, `Teamviewer_Desktop.exe`, `MsMpEng.exe`, `tv_w32.exe`, `VTTimer.exe`, `Tron.bat`, `rkill.exe`, `rkill64.exe`, `rkill.com`, `rkill64.com`, `conhost.exe`, `dashost.exe`, `wget.exe`

6. **Safe mode**: Set system to reboot into Safe Mode with Networking if a reboot occurs. Removes this and resets to normal bootup at the end of the script. Accomplished via this command:
   ```
   bcdedit /set {default} safeboot network
   ```

7. **Set system time via NTP**: Sync the system clock to time.nist.gov, 3.pool.ntp.org and time.windows.com

8. **Check and repair WMI**: Check the WMI interface and attempt repair if broken. Tron uses WMI for a lot of stuff including ISO date format conversion, OEM bloatware removal, and various other things, so having it functioning is critical

9. **[McAfee Stinger](http://www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/free-tools/stinger.aspx)**: Anti-malware/rootkit/virus standalone scanner from McAfee. Does not support plain-text logs so we save its HTML log to Tron's %LOGPATH%. Tron executes Stinger as follows:

  ```
  stinger32.exe --GO --SILENT --PROGRAM --REPORTPATH="%LOGPATH%" --RPTALL --DELETE
  ```

10. **[TDSS Killer](http://usa.kaspersky.com/downloads/TDSSKiller)**: Anti-rootkit utility from Kaspersky Labs. Tron executes TDSSKiller as follows:

  ```
  tdsskiller.exe -l %TEMP%\tdsskiller.log -silent -tdlfs -dcexact -accepteula -accepteulaksn
  ```

11. **[erunt](http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/)**: Used to backup the registry before beginning a Tron run

12. **VSS purge**: Purges oldest set of Volume Shadow Service files (basically snapshot-in-time copies of files). Malware can often hide out here

13. **Reduce system restore space**: Restrict System Restore to only use 7% of available hard drive space

13. **Disable sleep mode**: Tron uses `caffeine.exe` to disable sleep mode when the script starts. At the end of the script it resets power settings to Windows defaults. Using Tron's `-p` flag prevents resetting power settings to Windows default.


## STAGE 1: Tempclean

1. **Internet Explorer cleanup**: Runs built-in Windows tool to clean and reset Internet Explorer:

  ```
  rundll32.exe inetcpl.cpl,ClearMyTracksByProcess 4351
  ```

2. **[CCLeaner](https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner)**: CCLeaner utility by Piriform. Used to clean temp files before running AV scanners

3. **[BleachBit](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/)**: BleachBit utility. Used to clean temp files before running AV scanners

4. **TempFileCleanup.bat**: Script I wrote to clean some areas that other tools seem to miss

5. **[DriveCleanup.exe](http://www.uwe-sieber.de/drivetools_e.html#drivecleanup)**: Cleans unused/not present USB device drivers. Utility from Uwe Sieber

6. **Clear Windows event logs**: Backs up Windows event logs by default to the LOGPATH directory, then clears all log files

7. **Clear Windows Update cache**: Purges uninstaller files for already-installed Windows Updates. Typically frees up quite a bit of space


## STAGE 2: De-bloat

1. **OEM de-bloat** (by name): Use WMI to attempt to uninstall any program listed in this file:

  ```
  \tron\resources\stage_2_de-bloat\oem\programs_to_target_by_name.txt
  ```

2. **OEM de-bloat** (by GUID): Use WMI to attempt to remove specific list of GUIDs in this file:

  ```
  \tron\resources\stage_2_de-bloat\oem\programs_to_target_by_GUID.bat
  ```

3. **Metro de-bloat**: Remove built-in Metro apps that no one uses (does NOT remove things like Calculator, Paint) then purges them from the cache (can always fetch later from Windows Update)


## STAGE 3: Disinfect

1. **[Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.org/)**: Anti-malware scanner. Because there is no command-line support for MBAM, we simply install it and continue with the rest of the script. This way a tech can click **Scan** whenever they're around, but the script doesn't stall while waiting for user input. Using Tron's `-sa` or `-sm` flags skip this component

2. **[KVRT](http://www.kaspersky.com/antivirus-removal-tool)**: Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool. Using Tron's `-sa` or `-sk` flags skip this component

  ```
  -l %TEMP%\tdsskiller.log -silent -tdlfs -dcexact -accepteula -accepteulaksn
  ```

3. **[Sophos Virus Removal Tool](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/virus-removal-tool.aspx)**: Command-line anti-virus scanner. Using Tron's `-v` flag gives more verbose output. Using Tron's `-sa` or `-ss` flags skip this component


4. **[System File Checker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833)**: Microsoft utility for checking the filesystem for errors and attempting to repair if found. Only run on Windows Vista and up (XP and below require a reboot)


## STAGE 4: Repair

1. **DISM image check & repair**: Microsoft utility for checking the Windows Image Store (sort of a more powerful System File Checker). Windows 8 and up only

2. **Registry permissions reset**: Grant `SYSTEM` and `Administrator` users full permissions on HKLM, HKCU, and HKCR hives. This is an add-only permissions operation (does not remove any permissions). Using Tron's `-srr` flag skips this operation

3. **Filesystem permissions reset**: Grant `SYSTEM` and `Administrator` users full permissions on everything in the `%WinDir%` directory tree. Using Tron's `-sfr` flag skips this operation

4. **[System File Checker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833)**: Microsoft utility for checking the filesystem for errors and attempting to repair if found. Tron runs this on Windows Vista and up only (XP and below require a reboot)

5. **chkdsk**: Checks disk for errors and schedules a chkdsk with repair at next reboot

6. **Windows "telemetry" purge**: Disable Windows "telemetry" (user tracking), Windows 7 and up only. If the system is running Windows 7/8/8.1, Tron removes the "bad" updates Microsoft rolled out to Windows 7/8/8.1 systems after the Windows 10 release which backport the surveillance/spyware functions that are by default present in Windows 10 back to the older Windows versions. Tron removes these specific KB updates from Win 7/8/8.1: 2952664, 2976978, 2990214, 3021917, 3022345, 3068708, 3080149, 3075249, 3035583, 3044374, 971033. Tron also stops and deletes the `DiagTrack` ("Diagnostics Tracking Service") service. If the system is running Windows 10, Tron does a more in-depth disabling of the Windows telemetry features. Go over the code in `\tron\resources\stage_4_repair\purge_windows_telemetry\` to see exactly what is removed and disabled. Using Tron's `-str` flag skips this component

7. **Network repair**: Tron performs minor network repair. Specifically it runs these commands: `ipconfig /flushdns`,	`netsh interface ip delete arpcache`, `netsh winsock reset catalog`


## STAGE 5: Patch
Tron installs or updates these programs:

1. **[7-Zip](http://7-zip.org/faq.html)**: Open-source compression and extraction tool. Far superior to just about everything (including the venerable WinRAR). Using Tron's `-sp` flag skips this component

2. **Adobe Flash Player**: Used by YouTube and various other sites. Using Tron's `-sp` flag skips this component

3. **Adobe Reader**: Standard PDF reader. Using Tron's `-sp` flag skips this component

4. **Java Runtime Environment**: I hate Java, but it is still widely used so we at least get the system on the latest version. Using Tron's `-sp` flag skips this component

5. **Windows updates**: Self-explanatory

6. **DISM base reset**: Recompile the "Windows Image Store" after we finished purging old files from it earlier. Windows 8 and up only


## STAGE 6: Optimize

1. **Page file reset**: Reset the system page file settings to "let Windows manage the page file." Accomplished via this command:

    `%WMIC% computersystem where name="%computername%" set AutomaticManagedPagefile=True`

    Using the `-spr` flag skips this action

2. **chkdsk**: Checks disk for errors and schedules a chkdsk with repair at next reboot

3. **[Defraggler](https://www.piriform.com/defraggler)**: Command-line defrag tool from Piriform that's a little faster than the built-in Windows defragmenter


## STAGE 7: Wrap-up

1. **email_report**: Sends an email report with log file when Tron finishes. Requires you to specify your SMTP settings in `\resources\stage_7_wrap-up\email_report\SwithMailSettings.xml`

2. **generate summary logs**: Generate before and after logs detailing which files were deleted and which programs were removed. These are placed in `LOGPATH\tron_summary_logs`. Additionally, if `-er` flag was used or `EMAIL_REPORT` variable was set, these logs will be attached to the email that is sent out

## STAGE 8: Manual tools
Tron does not run these automatically because most of them don't support command-line use, or are only useful in special cases.

1. **[ADSSpy](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/ads-spy/)**: Scans for hidden NTFS Alternate Data Streams

2. **[AdwCleaner](https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/)**: Popular user-suggested adware removal tool
