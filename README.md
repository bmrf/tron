# DO NOT DOWNLOAD TRON FROM GITHUB, IT WILL NOT WORK!! YOU NEED THE ENTIRE PACKAGE FROM [/r/TronScript](https://www.reddit.com/r/TronScript) !!

I got tired of running these utilities manually and decided to just script everything, so Tron is essentially a glorified batch file that automates a variety of tasks to clean up and disinfect Windows machines.

# USE

0. FIRST THINGS FIRST: If there are pending Windows updates, reboot the machine and allow them to install. This isn't *required* but is strongly recommended.

1. [Boot into Safe Mode with Network Support](#safe-mode). If you skip this step Tron will prompt you to automatically reboot into Safe Mode. NOTE: Sometimes Tron works better in Normal mode, and sometimes Safe Mode. You don't *have* to run Tron in Safe Mode, but in general it seems to have better results that way which is why it's generally recommended.

2. Copy `tron.bat` and the `\resources` folder to the Desktop of target machine and run `tron.bat` as an **ADMINISTRATOR** 

3. Wait anywhere from **3-10 hours** (yes, it really takes that long; no, do **not** cancel it in the middle of it running)

  *Note: You'll need to manually click "scan" in the MBAM window that appears part of the way through Stage 3: Disinfect. Tron will continue in the background with its other tasks while waiting for you though, so the script won't stall if you're not around to hit "scan" immediately.*

4. **Reboot**

By default the master log file is at `C:\Logs\tron\tron.log`. If you want to change this, read the section on changing defaults below.

Tron will briefly check for a newer version when it starts up and notify you if one is available. It will also automatically download updates to the Stage 2: De-bloat lists of unwanted programs to target.

Depending how badly the system is infected, it could take anywhere from 3 to 10 hours to run. I've personally observed times between 4-8 hours, and one user reported a run time of 30 hours. Basically set it and forget it.


# COMMAND-LINE USE

Command-line use is fully supported. All flags are optional and can be used simultaneously. *

    tron.bat [-a -asu -c -d -dev -e -er -m -o -p -r -sa -sb -sd -sdc -sdu -se -sfr
              -sk -sm -sp -spr -srr -ss -str -sw -udl -v -x] | [-h]

    Optional flags (can be combined):

     -a   Automatic mode (no welcome screen or prompts; implies -e)
     
     -c   Config dump (display current config. Can be used with other
          flags to see what WOULD happen, but script will never execute
          if this flag is used)

     -d   Dry run (run through script without executing any jobs)
    
     -dev Override OS detection (allow running on unsupported Windows versions)

     -e   Accept EULA (suppress disclaimer warning screen)

     -er  Email a report when finished. Requires you to configure SwithMailSettings.xml

     -m   Preserve default Metro apps (don't remove them)

     -o   Power off after running (overrides -r)

     -p   Preserve power settings (don't reset to Windows default)

     -r   Reboot automatically (auto-reboot 15 seconds after completion)

     -sa  Skip ALL anti-virus scans (KVRT, MBAM, SAV)

     -sdb Skip de-bloat (OEM bloatware removal; implies -m)

     -sd  Skip defrag (force Tron to ALWAYS skip Stage 5 defrag)
     
     -sdc Skip DISM component (SxS store) cleanup
     
     -sdu Skip debloat update. Prevent Tron from auto-updating the S2 debloat lists

     -se  Skip Event Log backup and clear (don't clear Windows Event Logs)

     -sfr Skip filesystem permissions reset (saves time if you're in a hurry)

     -sk  Skip Kaspersky Virus Rescue Tool (KVRT) scan

     -sm  Skip Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (MBAM) installation

     -sp  Skip patches (do not patch 7-Zip, Java Runtime, Adobe Flash or Reader)

     -spr Skip page file reset (don't set to "Let Windows manage the page file")

     -srr Skip registry permissions reset (saves time if you're in a hurry)

     -ss  Skip Sophos Anti-Virus (SAV) scan

     -str Skip Telemetry Removal (just turn telemetry off instead of removing it)

     -sw  Skip Windows Updates (do not attempt to run Windows Update)
     
     -udl Upload debug logs. Send tron.log and the system GUID dump to the Tron developer

     -v   Verbose. Show as much output as possible. NOTE: Significantly slower!

     -x   Self-destruct. Tron deletes itself after running and leaves logs intact

    Misc flags (must be used alone):

     -h   Display help text


\* There is no -UPM flag


# SCRIPT INTERRUPTION

If the script is interrupted e.g. from a crash or a forced reboot (often encountered during stage_2_de-bloat), it will attempt to resume from the last stage successfully started. Tron accomplishes this by creating a `RunOnce` registry key for the current user at the beginning of Stage 0 (e.g. when jobs start executing), and deleting it at the end of the script if everything finished without interruption.

More details about this function can be found in the [list of all actions Tron performs](#full-tron-description) at the bottom of this document.


# SAFE MODE

When Tron launches it will briefly check if the computer is in Safe Mode with Networking, and if not it will prompt you to automatically reboot into it.

Tron doesn't *need* to be run in Safe Mode, but it is **strongly recommended**. 


# EMAIL REPORT
To have Tron send an email report at completion, edit this file:

    \tron\resources\stage_7_wrap-up\email_report\SwithMailSettings.xml

Specify your SMTP server, username, and password. After specifying your settings you can use the `-er` flag to have Tron send the email report. The summary logs (`tron_removed_files.txt` and `tron_removed_programs.txt`) will be attached as well.

Keep in mind the username and password for the email account will be stored in PLAIN TEXT so don't leave it lying around on a system you don't trust.


# CHANGE DEFAULTS (advanced)

If you don't want to use the command-line and don't like Tron's defaults, you can change the following default variables. Keep in mind command-line flags will always override their respective default option when used.

# FULL TRON DESCRIPTION
The best way to see what Tron does is simply crack open `Tron.bat` or one of the stage-specific subscripts with a text editor (preferably one with syntax highlighting) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/tron.bat) and just read the code. Every section has comments explaining exactly what it does, and you don't need to be able to read code to understand it. Barring that, here's a general description of every action Tron performs.

## tron.bat

*[link to code](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/tron.bat)*

Master script that launches everything else. It performs many actions on its own, but for any task not performed directly, we call an external utility or script. Each stage (e.g. Stage 1: Tempclean) has its own master script that Tron calls in sequence. Sub-stage scripts can be found in each stages subdirectory under the `\resources` folder. e.g. `\tron\resources\stage_1_tempclean\stage_1_tempclean.bat`


## Tron-internal prep jobs
(These are executed even if Tron is canceled before running)

0. **Detect TEMP execution**: Detect if we're running from the TEMP directory and prevent Tron from executing if so. TEMP is one of the first places to get wiped when Tron starts so we cannot run from there

1. **Make log directories**: Create the master log directory and sub-directories if they don't exist. By default this is `%SystemDrive%\Logs\tron.log`

1. **Detect Windows & IE versions**: Determines quite a few things in the script, such as which versions of various commands get executed

2. **Unsupported OS blocker**: Throw an alert message if running on an unsupported OS, then exit. Use the `-dev` flag to override this behavior and allow running on unsupported Windows versions

3. **Disk configuration check**: Check if the system drive is an SSD, Virtual Disk, or throws an unspecified error (couldn't be read by `smartctl.exe`) and set the `SKIP_DEFRAG` variable to `yes_ssd`, `yes_vm`, or `yes_error` respectively. If any of these conditions are triggered, Tron skips **Stage 5 defrag** automatically

4. **Detect free space**: Detect and save available hard drive space to compare against later. Simply used to show how much space was reclaimed; does not affect any script functions

5. **Detect resume**: Detect whether or not we're resuming after an interrupted run (e.g. from a reboot)

6. **Enable F8 Safe Mode selection**: Re-enable the ability to use the `F8` key on bootup (Windows 8 and up only; enabled by default on Server 2012/2012 R2)

7. **Check for network connection**: Check for an active network connection, and skip the update checks if one isn't found

7. **Check for update**: Compare the local copy of Tron to the version on the official repo (does this by reading latest version number from `sha256sums.txt`). If the local copy is out of date, Tron will ask to automatically download the latest copy (**always** recommended). If permitted, it will download a copy to the desktop, verify the SHA256 hash, then self-destruct (delete) the current outdated copy

8. **Update debloat lists**: Connect to Github and download the latest version of the Stage 2 debloat lists at initial launch. Use the `-sdu` (`SKIP_DEBLOAT_UPDATE`) switch to prevent this behavior. I recommend letting Tron update the lists unless you have a good, specific reason not to

8. **Detect Administrator rights**: Detect whether or not we're running as Administrator and alert the user if we're not

9. **Detect Safe Mode**: Detect whether or not we're in Safe Mode and notify the user if we're not. If not, Tron will prompt to automatically reboot into Safe Mode with Networking.

10. **Create RunOnce entry**: Create the following registry key to support resuming if there is an interruption: `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce /v "tron_resume" /t REG_SZ /d "%~dp0tron.bat %-resume"`

   Note: `-resume` is an internal flag not meant for human use at the command-line. If you use it, things will break and I will laugh at you.

11. **SMART check**: Dump the SMART status of all hard disks in the system, then display an alert if any drive reports one of the following status codes: `Error`,`Degraded`,`Unknown`,`PredFail`,`Service`,`Stressed`,`NonRecover`


## STAGE 0: Prep

*[link to Stage 0 code](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_0_prep/stage_0_prep.bat)*

2. **Create System Restore point**: Create a pre-run system restore point. Vista and up only, client OS's only (not supported on Server OS's, and on Windows 10 does not work if the system is in any form of Safe Mode. This is a known bug, and I spent hours trying to find a workaround but was not able to find a solution, so if you absolutely require a system restore point, recommend running in normal mode

3. **[Rkill](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/)**: Rkill is an anti-malware prep tool; it looks for and kills a number of known malware that interfere with removal tools. Rkill will NOT kill any process listed in `\resources\stage_0_prep\rkill\rkill_process_whitelist.txt` ([link](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_0_prep/processkiller/whitelist.txt))

4. **Create pre-run profile**: Dump list of installed programs and list of all files on the system so we can compare later and see exactly what was removed

5. **GUID dump**: Dump list of all installed program GUIDs. These dumps are useful in helping the project bolster the blacklist of known-bad GUIDs

6. **ProcessKiller**: Utility provided by [/u/cuddlychops06](https://www.reddit.com/user/cuddlychops06) which kills various userland processes. We use this to further kill anything that might interfere with Tron. ProcessKiller will kill everything in userland EXCEPT: `ClassicShellService.exe`, `explorer.exe`, `dwm.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `mbam.exe`, `teamviewer.exe`, `TeamViewer_Service.exe`, `Taskmgr.exe`, `Teamviewer_Desktop.exe`, `MsMpEng.exe`, `tv_w32.exe`, `VTTimer.exe`, `Tron.bat`, `rkill.exe`, `rkill64.exe`, `rkill.com`, `rkill64.com`, `conhost.exe`, `dashost.exe`, `wget.exe`

7. **Safe mode**: Set system to reboot into Safe Mode with Networking if a reboot occurs. Removes this and resets to normal bootup at the end of the script. Accomplished via this command:
   ```
   bcdedit /set {default} safeboot network
   ```

8. **Set system time via NTP**: Set the system clock to sync against the following NTP servers, in this order: `2.pool.ntp.org`, `time.windows.com`, `time.nist.gov`

9. **Check and repair WMI**: Check WMI interface and attempt repair if broken. Tron uses WMI for a lot of stuff including ISO date format conversion, OEM bloatware removal, and various other things, so having it functioning is critical

10. **[McAfee Stinger](http://www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/free-tools/stinger.aspx)**: Anti-malware/rootkit/virus standalone scanner from McAfee. Does not support plain-text logs so we save HTML log to Tron's `%LOGPATH%`. Tron executes Stinger as follows:

  ```
  stinger32.exe --GO --SILENT --PROGRAM --REPORTPATH="%LOGPATH%" --RPTALL --DELETE
  ```

11. **[TDSS Killer](http://usa.kaspersky.com/downloads/TDSSKiller)**: Anti-rootkit utility from Kaspersky Labs. Tron executes TDSSKiller as follows:

  ```
  tdsskiller.exe -l %TEMP%\tdsskiller.log -silent -tdlfs -dcexact -accepteula -accepteulaksn
  ```

12. **Backup registry:**: Use [erunt](http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/) to backup the registry prior to commencing scans

13. **VSS purge**: Purge oldest set of Volume Shadow Service files (basically snapshot-in-time copies of files). Malware can often hide out here

14. **Reduce system restore space**: Restrict System Restore to only use 7% of available hard drive space

15. **Disable sleep mode**: Tron uses `caffeine.exe` to disable sleep mode when the script starts. At the end of the script it resets power settings to Windows defaults. Use the `-p` flag prevents resetting power settings to Windows default.


## STAGE 1: Tempclean

*[link to Stage 1 code](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_1_tempclean/stage_1_tempclean.bat)*

1. **Internet Explorer cleanup**: Runs built-in Windows tool to clean and reset Internet Explorer:

  ```
  rundll32.exe inetcpl.cpl,ClearMyTracksByProcess 4351
  ```
  
  Executes only on Internet Explorer v7 and up

2. **[CCLeaner](https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner)**: CCLeaner utility by Piriform. Used to clean temp files before running AV scanners

3. **[BleachBit](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/)**: BleachBit utility. Used to clean temp files before running AV scanners

4. **[TempFileCleanup.bat](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_1_tempclean/stage_1_tempclean.bat)**: Script I wrote to clean some areas that other tools seem to miss

5. **[USB Device Cleanup](http://www.uwe-sieber.de/drivetools_e.html#drivecleanup)**: Uninstalls unused or not present USB devices from the system (non-existent thumb drives, etc etc). Uses `drivecleanup.exe` from [Uwe Sieber](http://www.uwe-sieber.de/)

6. **Cleanup duplicate downloads**: Searches for and delete duplicate files found in the Downloads folders of each user profile (`ChromeInstaller(1).exe`, `ChromeInstaller(2)exe`, etc). Does not touch any other folders. Uses Sentex's [Find Dupe](http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/finddupe/) utility

7. **Clear Windows event logs**: Back up Windows event logs to `%LOGPATH%` directory, then clear all entries

8. **Clear Windows Update cache**: Purge uninstaller files for already-installed Windows Updates. Typically frees up quite a bit of space. Accomplished via this command:
    
    ```
    rmdir /s /q %windir%\softwaredistribution\download
    ```


## STAGE 2: De-bloat

*[link to Stage 2 code](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_2_de-bloat/stage_2_de-bloat.bat)*

1. **OEM de-bloat** (by name): Use WMI to attempt to uninstall any program listed in [this file](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_2_de-bloat/oem/programs_to_target_by_name.txt):

  ```
  \tron\resources\stage_2_de-bloat\oem\programs_to_target_by_name.txt
  ```

2. **OEM de-bloat** (by GUID): Use WMI to attempt to remove specific list of GUIDs listed in [this file](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_2_de-bloat/oem/programs_to_target_by_GUID.bat):

  ```
  \tron\resources\stage_2_de-bloat\oem\programs_to_target_by_GUID.bat
  ```
  
3. **Toolbar & BHOs** (by GUID): Use WMI to attempt to remove specific list of GUIDs listed in [this file](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_2_de-bloat/oem/toolbars_BHOs_to_target_by_GUID.bat): 
  
  ```
  \tron\resources\stage_2_de-bloat\oem\toolbars_BHOs_to_target_by_GUID.bat
  ```

4. **Metro de-bloat**: Remove many built-in Metro apps that aren't commonly used (does NOT remove things like Calculator, Paint, etc) then purges them from the cache (can always fetch later from Windows Update). On Windows 8/8.1, removes all stock "Modern" apps. On Windows 10 and up, only removes a few specific Modern apps. You can see the full list of Metro apps removed [here](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_2_de-bloat/metro/metro_Microsoft_modern_apps_to_target_by_name.ps1) (Microsoft) and [here](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_2_de-bloat/metro/metro_3rd_party_modern_apps_to_target_by_name.ps1) (OEM/3rd party). Use the `-sb` switch (skip *all* de-bloat) or `-m` switch (skip only Metro de-bloat) to skip this action

5. **Remove OneDrive integration**: Remove forced OneDrive integration (Windows 10 only). Tron first checks if any files exist in the default OneDrive folder (`%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive\`) and skips removal if any are found. As a additional safety precaution, Tron leaves the OneDrive folder intact regardless whether OneDrive is removed or not.

## STAGE 3: Disinfect

*[link to Stage 3 code](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_3_disinfect/stage_3_disinfect.bat)*

1. **[Clear CryptNet SSL cache](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/issues/86)**: Wipe the Windows CryptNet SSL certificate cache by executing this command:  `certutil -URLcache * delete`

2. **[Malwarebytes Anti-Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.org/)**: Anti-malware scanner. Because there is no command-line support for MBAM, we simply install it and continue with the rest of the script. This way a tech can click **Scan** whenever they're around, but the script doesn't stall waiting for user input. Use the `-sa` or `-sm` flags skip this component

3. **[KVRT](http://www.kaspersky.com/antivirus-removal-tool)**: Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool. Use the `-sa` or `-sk` flags skip this component

  ```
  -l %TEMP%\tdsskiller.log -silent -tdlfs -dcexact -accepteula -accepteulaksn
  ```

4. **[Sophos Virus Removal Tool](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/virus-removal-tool.aspx)**: Command-line anti-virus scanner. Use the `-v` flag gives more verbose output. Use the `-sa` or `-ss` flags skip this component


## STAGE 4: Repair

*[link to Stage 4 code](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_4_repair/stage_4_repair.bat)*

0. **MSI installer cleanup**: Use the Microsoft `msizap.exe` utility to remove orphaned MSI installer files from the installer cache

1. **DISM image check & repair**: Microsoft utility for checking the Windows Image Store (sort of a more powerful System File Checker). Windows 8 and up only

2. **Registry permissions reset**: Grant `SYSTEM` and `Administrator` users full permissions on HKLM, HKCU, and HKCR hives. This is an add-only permissions operation (does not remove any permissions). Use the `-srr` flag skips this operation

3. **Filesystem permissions reset**: Grant `SYSTEM` and `Administrator` users full permissions on everything in the `%WinDir%` directory tree. Use the `-sfr` flag skips this operation

4. **[System File Checker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833)**: Microsoft utility for checking the filesystem for errors and attempting to repair if found. Tron runs this on Windows Vista and up only (XP and below require a reboot)

5. **chkdsk**: Checks disk for errors and schedules a chkdsk with repair at next reboot (marks volume dirty) if errors are found

6. **Disable Windows "telemetry"**: Disable Windows "telemetry" (user tracking), Windows 7 and up only. Tron removes the "bad" updates Microsoft pushed to Windows 7/8/8.1 systems after the Windows 10 release. These updates backport the surveillance/spyware functions that are by default present in Windows 10. See the code to see exactly which updates are removed. See the code ([Win7/8/8.1](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_4_repair/disable_windows_telemetry/purge_windows_7-8-81_telemetry.bat), [Win10](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_4_repair/disable_windows_telemetry/purge_windows_10_telemetry.bat)) to see exactly which KB's are removed. Tron also stops and deletes the `DiagTrack` ("Diagnostics Tracking Service") service. If the system is running Windows 10, Tron does a more in-depth disabling of the Windows telemetry features, including automatically applying all the immunizations from the [Spybot Anti-Beacon](https://www.safer-networking.org/spybot-anti-beacon/) and [O&O ShutUp10](https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10) tools. Go over the code in `\tron\resources\stage_4_repair\disable_windows_telemetry\` to see exactly what is removed and disabled. NOTE: This section takes a LONG time to run, DO NOT CANCEL IT. Use the -str switch to just turn telemetry off instead of removing it

7. **Disable Windows 10 upgrade**: Disables the Windows 10 upgrade nagger on Windows 7/8/8.1 by flipping the appropriate registry switches. Users can still manually upgrade the machine if they desire, but it will no longer nag via the system tray, auto-download, or auto-install Windows 10 without their permission

8. **Network repair**: Tron performs minor network repair. Specifically it runs these commands: `ipconfig /flushdns`, `netsh interface ip delete arpcache`, `netsh winsock reset catalog`

9. **File extension repair**: Tron repairs most default file extensions with a batch file that loops through a series of registry files stored in `\tron\resources\stage_4_repair\repair_file_extensions\`


## STAGE 5: Patch

*[link to Stage 5 code](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_5_patch/stage_5_patch.bat)*

Tron updates these programs if they exist on the system. If a program does not exist, it is skipped:

1. **[7-Zip](http://7-zip.org/faq.html)**: Open-source compression and extraction tool. Far superior to just about everything (including the venerable WinRAR). Use the `-sp` switch to skip this action

2. **Adobe Flash Player**: Used by YouTube and various other sites. Use the `-sp` switch to skip this action

3. **Adobe Reader**: Standard PDF reader. Use the `-sp` switch to skip this action

4. **Java Runtime Environment**: I personally hate Java, but it is still widely used, so we at least get the system on the latest version. Use the `-sp` switch to skip this action

5. **Windows updates**: Runs Windows update via this command:  `wuauclt /detectnow /updatenow`. Use the `-sw` switch to skip this action

6. **DISM base reset**: Recompile the "Windows Image Store" (SxS store). This typically results in multiple GB's of space freed up. Windows 8 and up only. Any Windows Updates installed *prior* to this point will become "baked in" (uninstallable). Use the `-sdc` switch to skip this action


## STAGE 6: Optimize

*[link to Stage 6 code](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/resources/stage_6_optimize/stage_6_optimize.bat)*

1. **Page file reset**: Reset the system page file settings to "let Windows manage the page file." Accomplished via this command:

    `%WMIC% computersystem where name="%computername%" set AutomaticManagedPagefile=True`

    Use the `-spr` flag skips this action

2. **[Defraggler](https://www.piriform.com/defraggler)**: Command-line defrag tool from Piriform that's a little faster than the built-in Windows defragmenter. Defrag is automatically skipped if the system drive is an SSD. Use the `-sd` flag forces Tron to ALWAYS skip defrag


## STAGE 7: Wrap-up

*stage-specific code is in [tron.bat](https://github.com/bmrf/tron/blob/master/tron.bat)*

1. **generate summary logs**: Generate before and after logs detailing which files were deleted and which programs were removed. These are placed in `<LOGPATH>\tron_summary_logs`. Additionally, if `-er` flag was used or `EMAIL_REPORT` variable was set, these logs will be attached to the email that is sent out

2. **Create restore point**: Create a post-run system restore point to mirror the one we created in Stage 0: Prep. Vista and up only, client OS's only, on Windows 10 does not work if the system is in any form of Safe Mode. See notes on System Restore in Stage 0 documentation for more information

3. **email_report**: Send an email report with the log file attached when Tron is finished. Requires you to specify your SMTP settings in `\resources\stage_7_wrap-up\email_report\SwithMailSettings.xml`

4. **upload debug logs**: Upload 'tron.log' and the system GUID dump (list of all installed program GUIDs) to the Tron developer (vocatus). Please use this option if possible, log files are extremely helpful in developing Tron! NOTE: `tron.log` can contain personal information like names of files on the system, the computer name, user name, etc, so if you're concerned about this please look through a Tron log first to understand what will be sent. I don't care what files are on random systems on the Internet, but just something to be aware of

## STAGE 8: Manual tools
